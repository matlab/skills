# Agent Skills Playground

A sandbox for prototyping and demonstrating [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for MATLAB and Simulink work. Skills here are experimental. They may be incomplete, change without notice, or migrate to an official toolkit over time.

> **For official skills, use Agentic Toolkits for MATLAB and Simulink:**
>
> - **[MATLAB Agentic Toolkit](https://github.com/matlab/matlab-agentic-toolkit)**: Gives your AI agent the knowledge and context to work efficiently with MATLAB and its toolboxes
> - **[Simulink Agentic Toolkit](https://github.com/matlab/simulink-agentic-toolkit)**: Give your AI coding agent the ability to read, build, edit, and test Simulink® models using Model-Based Design best practices.

## What this repo is for

- **Prototyping**: trying out new skill ideas.
- **Demos**: informal examples of what Agent Skills can do with MATLAB and Simulink.

## Demos

| Demo | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **[engineering-an-agent-skill](demos/engineering-an-agent-skill/)** | A test-first process for authoring your own Agent Skills, with a meta-skill that walks an agent through the five stages. Accompanies the [blog post](https://blogs.mathworks.com/matlab/2026/05/11/how-to-engineer-an-ai-skill-for-matlab/). |
| **[mbse-with-agentic-ai](demos/mbse-with-agentic-ai/)** | Agent-driven Model-Based Systems Engineering workflow in MATLAB and Simulink (RFLP methodology). Accompanies the [blog post](https://blogs.mathworks.com/simulink/2026/04/26/model-based-systems-engineering-and-agentic-ai/). |
| **[embedded-ai-deployment](demos/embedded-ai-deployment/)** | Agent-driven deployment of AI models to embedded hardware with MATLAB, Simulink, and Embedded Coder. Routes between native models compressed for lean targets (Cortex-M, DSP) and direct C/C++ generation from PyTorch and LiteRT models for high-performance hardware. Requires MATLAB R2026a. |
| **[lorenz-uihtml-app](demos/lorenz-uihtml-app/)** | An interactive Lorenz attractor, built by an agent using the [`matlab-uihtml-app-builder`](skills/matlab-uihtml-app-builder/) and [`matlab-uihtml-design`](skills/matlab-uihtml-design/) skills. An HTML control panel drives an `ode45` integration, with animated tracing, live speed control, mid-run stop, and PNG export. |
| **[boids-uihtml-app](demos/boids-uihtml-app/)** | An interactive Boids flocking simulator for learning emergence, built with the same two uihtml skills in the Warm Dark style. Live rule-weight sliders, behavior presets, a flock-order readout, per-boid inspection, and predator strikes. The README teaches the model through guided experiments. |
| **[assessment-generation-for-matlab-grader](demos/assessment-generation-for-matlab-grader/)** | Agent-driven generation of MATLAB Grader assessment items from a learning objective: descriptions, reference solutions, learner templates, randomized tests, and optional QTI 3 interchange files. Includes an instructor setup-guide skill for course rollouts. |
| **[ai-tutoring](demos/ai-tutoring/)** | A coordinated set of 11 skills that turn an agent into a course-aware MATLAB tutor: concept coaching, evidence-based debugging, practice activities, AI-use policies and guardrails, and session reports. Includes an instructor demo kit and example reports. |
| **[course-generation](demos/course-generation/)** | Agent-driven generation of complete MATLAB and Simulink courses in IMS Common Cartridge format, following the MATLAB Course Designer model. An instructor interview feeds the IDStack instructional-design pipeline; MATLAB Exercises are validated against a live MATLAB session and Simulink Exercises get real starter and solution models. |

## About Agent Skills

Skills are modular, portable capabilities that work across coding agents:

- **Composable**: skills stack together automatically when needed.
- **Efficient**: skills only load when relevant to the current task.
- **Executable**: skills combine instructions with code, not just text.

See the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for the file format.

## Install a single skill

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matlab/agent-skills-playground.git
cp -r agent-skills-playground/skills/<skill-name> ~/.claude/skills/
```

For Claude.ai (web) and Claude Desktop, zip a skill's directory (with `SKILL.md` at the root) and upload it via **Settings**, then **Capabilities**, then **Upload Skill**.

For other agents, follow the host's instructions for installing user-defined skills.

## Run a demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matlab/agent-skills-playground.git
cd agent-skills-playground/demos/<demo-name>
```

Each demo folder is self-contained: it bundles its own skills under `skills/`, a tutorial README, and any supporting files. Open the folder in your agent (for Claude Code, run `claude` from inside the folder) and follow the demo's README.
